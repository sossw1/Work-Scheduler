# Work-Scheduler

This site features a scheduler for a typical 9AM-5PM shift. It allows the user to fill text areas with tasks and then save them. Items that are saved will persist using local storage.

# Usage

This scheduler automatically updates the current date, which makes it reusable no matter which weekday it is used. The text areas are color-coordinated (during work hours) to show the current time block in red and future time blocks in green.
